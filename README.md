# Expo Camera Preview Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera component where the preview intermittently fails to display correctly. The preview may show a blank screen or a frozen image.  This issue occurs inconsistently and lacks clear error messages in the console, making it challenging to debug.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the camera preview. The preview might work initially but might fail after some actions (like screen rotation).

## Solution

A potential solution involves careful handling of asynchronous operations and component lifecycle events. The provided `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a possible approach to mitigation, although a permanent fix may require changes in the Expo Camera component itself. The solution focuses on ensuring the camera is properly initialized and that state updates are handled synchronously to avoid race conditions.
