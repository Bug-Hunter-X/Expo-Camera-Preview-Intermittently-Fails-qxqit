This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component within a React Native application.  The issue manifests as an intermittent failure to properly display the camera preview, resulting in a blank screen or a frozen image. This happens inconsistently, making debugging difficult. The error is not consistently caught by standard error handling, and no specific error messages appear in the console.  The problem seems related to the interaction between the `Camera` component, asynchronous operations, and potentially Expo's internal state management.  The camera preview might work initially, but after certain actions (like screen rotation or other component lifecycle events), the preview fails to refresh or update correctly.
